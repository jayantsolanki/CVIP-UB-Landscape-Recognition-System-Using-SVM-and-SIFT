# CVIP-UB-Landscape-Recognition-System-Using-SVM-and-SIFT

## Project Summary

* This project talks about the detailed implementation of different categories based scene recognition using geometric correspondence of different interest points detected on the images using SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform). These interest points are based upon the changing gradient of the pixel intensities and summarized to form the local key descriptors for a particular image. In this project we have used another form of SIFT, known as Dense-SIFT as they are supposed to perform better in the object categorization. Our proposed system builds a representation based on bag of visual words and uses SVM classifier along with spatial pyramid matching for classifying the landscape categories. For classification of images, we tried classifiers like SVM with different kernels and KNN and achieved highest accuracy on linear SVM.
